    <div>Itachi Uchiha (うちは イタチ, Uchiha Itachi) is a character in the Naruto manga and anime series created by Masashi
        Kishimoto.
        Itachi is the older brother of Sasuke Uchiha, and is responsible for killing all the members of their clan,
        sparing only
        Sasuke. He appears working as a terrorist from the organisation Akatsuki and serves as Sasuke's greatest enemy.
    </div>
    <div class="sticky">
        During the second part of the manga, Itachi becomes involved in attacks to ninjas possessing tailed-beast
        creatures
        (Jinchuriki) until facing Sasuke in a one-on-one battle. Although Itachi perishes during the final duel, it is
        later
        revealed that Itachi had a secret reason for assassinating the Uchiha clan. Itachi is a playable character in
        most of
        the video games from the series. Itachi's character has been popular with readers of the manga[6] and has been
        positively received by critics. He is considered by many to be one of the best characters in the series. His
        appearance
        as an antagonist has been praised by several writers, although some have considered his initial appearance to be
        unsurprising. The gradual revelations of his past and its impact on the story has also received positive
        reception,[7][8] and his fights were noted to be "one of the best" in the series.[9][10][11] Numerous types of
        merchandise have been released in Itachi's likeness, including keychains, plush dolls and figurines.</div>

            Itachi is a member of the Uchiha Clan from the village of Konohagakure and the elder brother of Sasuke
            Uchiha. He grew

            Uchiha to
            live up to.[17] His early childhood was marred by war, the violence of which caused him to seek peace at any
            cost. Upon
            learning that his clan was planning a coup d'état to take control of Konoha, after his clan was accused of
